# Overview
## Problem Statement
We need to be able to identify digital objects with URL's that indicate that it is a photo negative. The existing reports in ArchivesSpace do not return digital object urls.

## Goals
- Create a Report that display's the Digital Object's URL.
- Make said report usable in ArchivesSpace's reports.
- Clean up old Vufind Objects

# Background
A long time ago, Beinecke staff created photonegs of collection material and mailed them to requesting patronsâ€”these were some of our earliest facsimiles. The decision was made to not migrate these photonegs to DCS as they are not preservation-quality images. However, some of these photonegs were attached to finding aids.


# Process
See [digital_object_report.sql](digital_object_report.sql), [digital_object_links_report.rb](digital_object_links_report.rb), [en.yml](en.yml), [_oid.html.erb](_oid.html.erb), [_parent.html.erb](_parent.html.erb), and [_url.html.erb](_url.html.erb)
- Write [SQL query](digital_object_report.sql) to pull Digital Objects with file URLs
    - Create CSV file and submit to DCSA for review
- Delete necessary digital objects
- Write ArchivesSpace Report in ruby
    - Create [model report](digital_object_links_report.rb)
    - Add necessary paramaters ([oid](_oid.html.erb), [parent id](_parent.html.erb), and [url](_url.html.erb)) to report to allow for more robust querying from users.
    - Update [en.yml](en.yml)
